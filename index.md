# Data Workshops Portfolio

This is a repository of teaching materials designed by me for educational purposes and public speaking occasions. 
The goal of the workshops is to teach how to use a specific technology, tool or framework by applying it to a practical project.
See below a brief description of each workshop and click on the corresponding link to see the presentation slides and teaching materials.
 
## Workshops:
 
###  [A/B Test Results Analysis in Tableau](https://github.com/annafedotova/dsgo_abtest)
You will become “data analyst for a day” joining the **Discovery department at the Wikimedia Foundation**. We will go through a real dataset that was collected during an **A/B test on Wikipedia’s new search functionality.** We will follow all the steps of a typical data analysis process: formulating the question, preparing data for analysis, analyzing results from the A/B test, and getting insights ready for our presentation to business stakeholders.

### [Intro to Data Visualization with Tableau](https://github.com/annafedotova/allwomen_tableau)
This practical Tableau workshop gives an introduction into the topic of data visualization in 2 parts. 
Part 1 covers the theory of data visualization fundamentals, including some best practices and things to avoid.
We will start learning Tableau by first doing an Exploratory Data Analysis of Netflix series dataset. 
We will move on to building our first Tableau dashboard using Asylum dataset. 
Finally, there will be a homework assignment using OECD Meat Consumptuion Datasets. 
Part 2 will cover intermediate Tableau concepts, such as calculated fields, table calculations, groups and sets and parameters.
* **Keywords**: *Data Visualization, Tableau*

### [Build your first dashboard in Dash](https://github.com/annafedotova/dash)
Dash is a Python framework written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js and used for building web applications. With Dash it is possible to build an interactive web app purely in Python, with no need of using Javascript, HTML or CSS. 
In this workshop we will be creating an interactive dashboard using Dash. We will start by covering the basics of Plotly, a Python data visualization library that permits building interactive graphs. We will then move on to understanding how Dash HTML and core components are combined to generate a layout of our app. Finally, we will learn how to add interactivity to our dashboards. As a result of the workshop will have built an interactive dashboard in Python.
* **Keywords**: *Data Visualization, Python, Plotly, Dash*
